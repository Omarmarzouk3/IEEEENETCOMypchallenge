# IEEE ENETCOM YP CHallenge :

## Overview :
This is our repositary explaining our solution in YP challenge for the TSYP X event. It includes the solution description, the research papper and the articles that we extracted informations from during our flight.

## Layout: 
this repos is splitted into x subdirectories to a better explaination, in order each sub-directory has a short description for the technologies used for our solutions and a research paper or an article to provide its advancement, the tech used and our needs from it.


## Description: 
NASA is rapidly moving forward on the Artemis program to send the
first woman and the next man to the South Pole of the Moon by 2024
and establish sustainable exploration with commercial and
international partners by 2028. the Artemis program will use the
Moon as a testbed for crewed exploration farther into the solar
system, beginning with Mars.On this topic, we must come up with a solution to help facilitate the astronaut’s
daily tasks, while applying the principles of Human augmentation, in order to assure mission success. In order to enhance our skills on researching slkill and sharpening our technical skills since it is The goal of this challenge in alignment with the IEEE Goals.

As our mission is to provide solution to help our astonauts to achieve their goals from this mission on its perfect way and with zeros tolerance, so thats why we obliged to integrate Human augmentation and assistance systems (HAAS).

Our solution is focusing on the psycoligical side for our astronauts since mental health can highly either increase or decrease performance.
each taks is depending on the astronaut's mental stability, focus state and concetration, so our solution will take part of most of the tasks.

Our solution is based on detecting vitals signs and emotions of astonauts using brain sensors and computer vision model.

Decisions will be taken depending on the data collected by these componenents. 

The application of HAAS will be applied in the treatement phase.

Treatement phase:
depending on the inputs (Brain sensors, Computer vision model) many variables will be extracted and used in a specefic mathematical formula.

This formula in not yet fixed until discussing the Idea with Doctors , scientists and man of knowledge.

Scaling system will be composed of 3 levels:

-First level:   0 => 3  :Special type of Calming music.	
-Second Level:  3 => 7  :Special message using wearable technology
-Third Level:   7=>10   :Emergency Alert to all nearby astonauts and gateaway, in this level an injection with chemical substances depending on the case.
